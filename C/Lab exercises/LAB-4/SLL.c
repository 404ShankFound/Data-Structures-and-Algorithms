/*Write a menu-driven C program using structures to implement the following operations on a 
singly linked list: 
➢ Insert an element before another specified element in the list 
(Example: Insert 10 before 25) 
➢ Insert an element after another specified element in the list 
(Example: Insert 40 after 25) 
➢ Delete a specified element from the list 
(Example: Delete node containing 15) 
➢ Traverse the list and display all elements 
➢ Reverse the linked list 
(Modify the links such that the list is reversed) 
➢ Sort the list in ascending order 
(Using Bubble Sort or any appropriate algorithm on linked list) 
➢ Delete every alternate node in the list 
(Starting from the second node) 
➢ Insert an element into a sorted linked list while maintaining the sorted order 
(Example: Insert 28 into a list that is already sorted) 
Requirements 
Use dynamic memory allocation (malloc/free) for node creation and deletion.*/
