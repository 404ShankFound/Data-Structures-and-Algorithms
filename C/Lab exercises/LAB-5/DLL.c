/*1. Write a menu-driven C program using structures to implement the following operations 
on a Doubly Linked List. 
➢ Insert an element at the rear end of the list 
(Append a new node to the end of the list) 
➢ Delete an element from the rear end of the list 
(Remove the last node in the list) 
➢ Insert an element at a given position in the list 
(e.g., Insert at position 3. Positioning starts from 1.) 
➢ Delete an element from a given position in the list

DS LAB MANUAL 
Date: 
➢ Insert an element after a node containing a specific value 
(e.g., Insert 40 after 25) 
➢ Insert an element before a node containing a specific value 
(e.g., Insert 10 before 25) 
➢ Traverse the list in forward direction 
(From head to tail) 
➢ Traverse the list in reverse direction 
(From tail to head – i.e., reverse traversal) 
Requirements: 
• Use dynamic memory allocation (malloc and free). 
• Maintain both head and tail pointers for efficient operations. 
• Use appropriate functions for modular implementation of each operation. 
2.Write a program to concatenate two doubly linked lists X1 and X2. After concatenation, X1 
should point to the first node of the resulting list.
